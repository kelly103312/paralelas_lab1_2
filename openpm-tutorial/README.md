This repository contains the Labs for an OpenMP tutorial.

Slides can be found in this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1_ef7_8HCRWWSYVeeCjtxzD7HARr19Ynf)

This is work in progress and it still does not cover the whole specification. The complete envision sillabus is in the google drive folder above. The current status is part 1 and part 4, with its respective labs in this repository. 

Feel free to suggest changes and fix stuff.
